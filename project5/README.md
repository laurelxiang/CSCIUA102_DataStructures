## Project 5

The goal of this project is to implement a program that uses a binary search tree to model a mountain hiking expedition: 
A hiker starts at the top of the mountain. They need to find their way down the mountain with limited resources to survive and overcome obstacles. 
Your program will produce a list of all the possible paths that the hiker should take to survive.

The mountain is represented by a binary search tree. Nodes in this tree represent a rest-stops. The hiker restocks their supplies at those rest-stops. 
But they may also encounter obstacles at the rest-stops. Some of the supplies that they carry with them may help them pass through the obstacles. 
The paths from the root down represent possible trails. One the hiker starts a single path, they do not have an option of going back. 
Some of the paths lead to cliffs, others leads to the bottom of the mountain. 

This is a console based program.
