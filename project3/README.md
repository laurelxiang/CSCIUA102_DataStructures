## Project 3

"You are going to write a program that uses our new data structures, stack and queue, to explore a maze and, hopefully, find a way out of it. 
There are many algorithms that use different data structures and different strategies to explore mazes. In this assignment you will try two such approaches. 
In both of these approaches you will start from some initial position within the maze and evaluate the neighboring spaces until either you find a way out, 
or you discover that there is no way out. The rough outline of both approaches is to examine spaces around the current position and decide which need to be 
examined further and which definitely do not lead to an exit (more details below in the algorithm description)."
Main goal: the main goal of this programming project is to get out of a maze.
