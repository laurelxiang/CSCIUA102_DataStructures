## Project 2

Wikipedia has a good description of open data: "Open data is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control." In fact, you will be working with an open data set that is a collection of open data sets. Data is Plural is a project run by Jeremy Singer-Vine. You can subscribe to his newsletter and get a fresh collection of interesting data sets each week. Or, you can browse the archives dating back to 2015.

This program will explores this open data set and allow the user to make queries about it using a console based interface.
